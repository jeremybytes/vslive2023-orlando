# LINQ - It's Not Just for Databases  

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is mostly associated with Entity Framework and database access. But it can be used for much more. LINQ lets us sort, filter, and aggregate data all in memory without needing to make another database call. We will use the LINQ fluent syntax to combine functions and make a great experience for our users.

What you will learn:  
* Use LINQ methods to sort, filter, and aggregate data  
* Understand the Func parameter commonly used in LINQ methods  
* Use lambda expressions as LINQ parameters
